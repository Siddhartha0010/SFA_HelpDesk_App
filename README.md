Final Project of My Intership at HCCB

Introduction:
Created a Fully static Help Desk Website for a Existing App in the Organisation called SFA 2.0 app.
So the main use case of this project is to help the employees in the organisation with their daily activities with the app.
This Website acts as a one stop platform for all the doubts and issues related to SFA 2.0 app

Key Highlights:
1)It has Crisp Video tutorials under 1 minute in both english and telugu languages.
2)Knowledge based chatbot which answers simple doubts related to app.
3)Simplified Schemes section: Where all the schemes present in all the apps related to the organisation are brought to one place with enhanced UI. So the employees can get access to all schemes details from coke buddy and SFA apps

Technologies Used:
1)Microsoft ClimpChamp for AI Voice Generation for the tutorials.
2)Front end technologies:Html,Css,Js
3)Backend Technologies:Mongodb
4)Deployement:Vercel,Render,Netlify - for the deployements of Chatbot,Frontend&Backend

Conclusion:
As a Btech Cse Student I have worked along the presellers on-site and understood the app postives,negatives and scope for improvements.
Responses were collected through google forms and based on these real time feedbacks this website is designed.
